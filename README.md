Forecasting the Photovoltaic Power using Deep Learning Algorithms

Description:

To build an efficient deep learning based prediction model for solar power generated using Long short-term memory(LSTM), Bidirectional Long short - term memory(Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit techniques.

A comparative analysis is done based on the three techniques mentioned in the below.
LSTM
Bi-LSTM
GRU
